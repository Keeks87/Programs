#Imagine you want to store the names of three of your friends in a list of strings. 
#Create a list variable called friends_names, and write the syntax to store the full
#names of three of your friends.
    #Now, write statements to print out the name of the first friend, then the name of 
    #the last friend, and finally the length of the list.
    #Now, define a list called friends_ages that stores the age of each of your friends
    #in a corresponding manner, i.e., the first entry of this list is the age of the 
    #friend named first in the other list.

#Create variable
friends_names = ["Ryan","John","Simon"]

#Print name of first friend
print(friends_names [0])

#Print name of last friend
print(friends_names [-1])

#Print length of the list
print(len(friends_names))

#Define Friends age list
friends_ages = [35,40,34]
